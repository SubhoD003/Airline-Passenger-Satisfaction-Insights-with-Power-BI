#About the report

Sharing my newest work on visualizing Maven Analytics ‘Airline Passenger Satisfaction’ dataset where I harnessed the power of Power BI to analyse Passengers’ 
satisfaction with the airline services data. 

Key Insights:

1. Which percentage of airline passengers are satisfied? Does it vary by customer type? What about type of travel?
2. What is the customer profile for a repeating airline passenger?
3. Does flight distance affect customer preferences or flight patterns?
4. Which factors contribute to customer satisfaction the most? What about dissatisfaction?

Skills Utilized:

1. Data Cleaning & Transformation
2. DAX Calculations
3. Advanced Data Visualizations
4. Interactive Reporting

This project strengthened not only my technical abilities, but also my ability to translate difficult data into useful and practical insights.
